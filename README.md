# SmartPythonGenerator

So I'm a business intelligence guy with an interest in programming. I love programming because of the freedom it gives me to create custom built solutions that solve real problems faced by businesses or people.

This is basically a script that takes raw text input from a user who's good at process mapping and then generates a skeleton code for them to type into. Process Mapping offers clarity that easily that helps you create python files that have the functions and variables written into
the file.

The first goal would be to create the following 
generator functions implementing best practices:
-[x] Variable Generations
-[ ] Function Generations
-[ ] Classes and file Generations
-[ ] Database Generations

Basic Variable Generation has been completed - generates good practice variable names
for usage by any python codewriter. Uses camelCase to generate unique names and appends the dataType to the varName to make it obvious to the programmer. Adds a comment to the end of the line as well - to show what the variables mean.
